# How branches work
Branches in the elcrypt repositories represent the code's version. At a branch, no matter how many commits it gets, it will always give the same hashed output. Only reason there is a dot after the version number is to track change versions. So, if you find a bug, create an issue, say what version you are using and someone will fix it for your code version, without changing the outputed hash. This way, you can keep up to date with your code or even change language completely without ruining already hashed codes.

# Credits
Thanks so much to [@legolord208](https://github.com/legolord208/) for creating the test script that will be used universally in all ports of the algorithm. It really means a lot to me as it was a job I couldn't possibly do myself.
